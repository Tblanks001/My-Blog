  "description": "After failing to generate much profit from the Rectangle Corner booth we had at Super Nova 2024, I decided to get a few jobs to get more money for the business. I went on Indeed and saw a job as a crew member for the Rocky Mountain Youth Corps. I applied and got a quick response back, which is what I was looking for. I had no interest in waiting it out to see if there were better job offers. I just wanted to make some money and obtain a new experience.",
