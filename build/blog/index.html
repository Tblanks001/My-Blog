I traveled to a lot of tournaments, and got to meet so many people; many of which I wouldn&#x27;t recognize if I meet again so don&#x27;t be mad at me please (I can&#x27;t remember all these got dang faces!).</p><p>Anyway, this X/Twitter post I made was of me reflecting on all the traveling, filming, and editing I did the entire year. I was proud of myself for reaching 1,000 subscribers. I never thought I could reach so many people. It gave me hope for the future, and I was so excited to continue this journey.</p><p>Then 2023 hit.</p><p>This was the worst year of my life.</p><p>My Wells Fargo remote job fired me, so I had to stop traveling to work at U-Haul. I had quit my job at U-Haul in 2021 and moved to Albuquerque when I landed the remote job. It felt like I was back at square one.</p><p>The remote job was fining me $10,000 because I had breached their contract to stay in Houston. They were ending remote work, but I had no idea I wasn&#x27;t allowed to move. There are Wells Fargo locations everywhere, so I thought I could just work at any location.</p><p>In addition to U-Haul, I also decided to work at Whataburger to make more money to pay for the fine.</p><p>All of these things hit me so hard. I had no idea what to do. I felt like I had failed. I was just at the top of the world, traveling to several different states and even Canada. Now I&#x27;m stuck in a small fast food kitchen taking orders.</p><p>After a few months working at Whataburger, I decided to quit. My mental health was deteriorating, and it was taking everything in me not to just up and leave while on the shift. They mainly had me at the window taking orders or handing the food out. It was tearing me up inside having to stand in one spot without any freedom of movement.</p><p>After about 7-8 months working at U-Haul, I decided to drive back to Houston for a break. I was only planning to be there for about a month. Unfortunately, my car was having issues, and would not be able to handle the long drive back to Albuquerque. I needed to make some money to fix the car before I could make my trip back. I called my boss at the U-Haul location in Albuquerque and asked him to transfer me to my old location in Houston.</p><p>This was an amazing experience. Initially, I felt like an utter failure having to go back to the job I had left when I got my remote job opportunity with Wells Fargo. I was back in the same place I was when I started. It felt embarrassing seeing the coworkers I had told I was leaving for a better job just about a year ago. I thought I was back at square one.</p><p>However, this feeling within me did not remain that way. My coworkers were so kind and understanding. They did not look down or belittle me, they welcomed me and appreciated my presence. I had a lot of fun hanging out with them. It never felt like I was working when I was around them. My mental health was improving through an unexpected source.</p><p>Before I left back to Albuquerque, me and my coworkers had a going away party at an Anime bar. I&#x27;m so glad I got the chance to go back to my old job. It not only humbled me, but changed the way I viewed success. I no longer want to work in a office job or even a salaried job. I feel that true success is when you are able to do what you want without fear of failure. The happiness I felt going back to the U-Haul in Houston showed me that as long as I&#x27;m around people who uplift and make me happy, I don&#x27;t care how much money I&#x27;m making.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/goals">Goals</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/why-i-deleted-my-social-media">Why I Deleted My Social Media</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2025-08-14T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">August 14, 2025</time> · <!-- -->2 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://travisblanks.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://github.com/endiliey.png" alt="Travis Blanks"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://travisblanks.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Travis Blanks</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Jack of All Trades</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I deleted my social media accounts because they are getting in the way of me accomplishing my goals. They have become distractions to my mission.</p><p>My main goal is to become the fastest human being of all time. Although I have other ambitions, they are not as important as this one. I have decided to do whatever it takes to accomplish this goal. That includes removing the things in my life that have become hindrances.</p><p>I actually have 4 main goals, but sprinting is the one I will be spending the most time on. Here they are in order of least to most important:</p><ol><li>Sprinting</li><li>Melee</li><li>Dual Hearts</li><li>Trombone</li></ol><p>No matter how much I look at this list, I can’t find any way to compromise and fit other things in. I’m barely gonna have enough time as it is to work on these things. After a lot of time thinking and reflecting, I decided to throw away several other goals and just focus on these ones.</p><p>I will still be making content (Heck, I’m doing it right now), but I will only be posting content on a few websites and YouTube.</p><p>There’s one last thing I want to say. I’ve made some promises to people involving creating videos or playing a certain video game. I want to apologize for not completing those promises. I can no longer live a life where I am not focusing on myself. It has worn me down far too long trying to satisfy others. I am a truly selfish person at heart, and I can not lie to myself any longer.

I went on Indeed and saw a job as a crew member for the Rocky Mountain Youth Corps. I applied and got a quick response back, which is what I was looking for. I had no interest in waiting it out to see if there were better job offers. I just wanted to make some money and obtain a new experience.</p><p>After landing the job, I applied around and got another job at Wendy’s. I was working about 60 hours a week at these two jobs. The Youth Corps job was 8 days on and 6 days off. I would work at Wendy’s on the days off.</p><div class="tabs-container tabList__CuJ"><ul role="tablist" aria-orientation="horizontal" class="tabs"><li role="tab" tabindex="0" aria-selected="true" class="tabs__item tabItem_LNqP tabs__item--active">Youth Corps</li><li role="tab" tabindex="-1" aria-selected="false" class="tabs__item tabItem_LNqP">Wendy&#x27;s</li><li role="tab" tabindex="-1" aria-selected="false" class="tabs__item tabItem_LNqP">UPS</li><li role="tab" tabindex="-1" aria-selected="false" class="tabs__item tabItem_LNqP">Conclusion</li></ul><div class="margin-top--md"><div role="tabpanel" class="tabItem_Ymn6"><iframe width="646" height="363" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3tXFqQgejw8" title="What I Got Goin&#x27; On" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" style="display:block;margin-bottom:1.5rem"></iframe><p>I had an amazing time at the Youth Corps. It was my first time camping outside. I can’t believe how fulfilling it is to set up a tent, make a campfire, and just hang out around it. It taught me that there is way more fun to be had outside than being cooped up inside all of the time.</p></div><div role="tabpanel" class="tabItem_Ymn6" hidden=""><img loading="lazy" src="/img/wendys-1.jpg" alt="A picture of me in the bathroom of Wendy&#x27;s. I have my Wendy&#x27;s uniform on, and I have a newly shaven head" style="max-width:100%;margin-bottom:1rem" class="img_ev3q">My time at Wendy’s was surprising. I didn’t expect to have a good experience because of how boring and tedious my last fast food job at Whataburger was. It turned out to be a slightly more impactful experience than the Youth Corps, believe it or not. I made so many friends, and even got to hang out at one of my coworker’s houses for Christmas. Not to mention the free food! I’m actually planning on going back to Taos next year, and the main reason for that is because of the people I befriended at this one rundown Wendy’s in the small town of Taos.</div><div role="tabpanel" class="tabItem_Ymn6" hidden=""><video controls="" style="width:100%;aspect-ratio:16/9"><source src="/vid/ups-1.mp4" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video><p>After the season at the Youth Corps was over, I decided to stay for a few more months. While I was going to pick up some mail, a UPS worker told me they were hiring, so I decided to apply. Luckily, I was hired immediately, because I wasn’t keen on waiting for another job. I was still in that money making mode. I was a pre-loader, which is a person who loads the trucks with packages before the UPS drivers get there to begin their routes. This job was probably the 2nd physically hardest job I’ve had (The Youth Corps takes the #1 spot because of how hard it is to go several miles uphill and downhill daily) because of how cold it was in the morning. It was also difficult waking up at 4am and walking into the sheer cold. It was slightly easier for me because I would sleep in my car right outside of the facility.</p></div><div role="tabpanel" class="tabItem_Ymn6" hidden="">Overall, I would say that my time in Taos was incredible. I can’t believe I had the courage to go and visit the unknown while sleeping in my car, which is another unknown. I had no idea if it would work, but I made it work. I’m glad I did this because it showed me what’s truly important to me; and that’s enjoying life and experiencing new things. And I don’t need to live in a house or apartment to do that.</div></div></div></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/jobs">Jobs</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/My-Car">My Car</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2025-07-21T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">July 21, 2025</time> · <!-- -->2 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://travisblanks.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://github.com/endiliey.png" alt="Travis Blanks"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://travisblanks.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Travis Blanks</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Jack of All Trades</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>This is my car</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="My car with a new roof rack for extra storage during travels." src="/assets/images/car-dccaec4e01af786d695bf223e90027b9.jpg" width="4032" height="2268" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>I have spent the past few months soft modifying the vehicle.

I might leave it off because it gives me slightly more space.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="A netting around my car door" src="/assets/images/within-car-ea7e81159a428adbdfe8c08797fc93b3.jpg" width="4032" height="2268" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>This is a closer look inside of the car. It’s a bit messy, but I’m getting better at organizing as time goes on.</p><p>Overall, I think this is an improved version of the setup I had when I was in Taos. I just realized I never talked about the Taos trip. The trip is very important because it inspired me to do what I’m planning on doing. I’ll talk about that in the next post.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/car">Car</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/first-blog-post">First Blog Post</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2025-07-10T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">July 10, 2025</time> · <!-- -->One min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://travisblanks.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://github.com/endiliey.png" alt="Travis Blanks"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://travisblanks.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Travis Blanks</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Jack of All Trades</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>This is my first day making a website from scratch.
